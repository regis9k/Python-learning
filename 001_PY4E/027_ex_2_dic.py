# Exercise 1: Download a copy of the file www.py4e.com/code3/words.txt

# Write a program that reads the words in words.txt and stores them as 
# keys in a dictionary. It doesnâ€™t matter what the values are. Then you 
# can use the in operator as a fast way to check whether a string is in the dictionary.
